Abstract = {{ERA-Interim is the latest global atmospheric reanalysis produced by the
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The
   ERA-Interim project was conducted in part to prepare for a new
   atmospheric reanalysis to replace ERA-40, which will extend back to the
   early part of the twentieth century. This article describes the forecast
   model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce
   ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special
   emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production
   of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the
   quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of
   the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements
   in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is
   needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis
   projects at ECMWF. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal Meteorological Society}},

Funding-Text = {{ECMWF reanalysis is the product of many years of outstanding scientific
   research and development by a large number of individuals. Human as well
   as technical resources for computing, data services, and user support at
   ECMWF are excellent and greatly appreciated. Interest and feedback from
   users of reanalysis data are instrumental to improve the quality of our
   products. International collaborations with data providers and
   reanalysis producers have been invaluable to our work. Preparation and
   production of ERA-Interim has been supported by staff secondments from
   the NCAS, the JMA, and the KMA. Work at the University of Leeds on the
   evaluation of the stratospheric circulation produced by ERA-Interim was
   partly funded by the NERC and by the European Commission via the GEOMON
   project.}},
