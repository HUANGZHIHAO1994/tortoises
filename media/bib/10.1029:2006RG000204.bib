Abstract = {{More than a decade ago, ice core records from Greenland revealed that
   the last glacial period was characterized by abrupt climate changes that
   recurred on millennial time scales. Since their discovery, there has
   been a large effort to determine whether these climate events were a
   global phenomenon or were just confined to the North Atlantic region and
   also to reveal the mechanisms that were responsible for them. In this
   paper, we review the available paleoclimate observations of abrupt
   change during the last glacial period in order to place constraints on
   possible mechanisms. Three different mechanisms are then reviewed: ocean
   thermohaline circulation, sea ice feedbacks, and tropical processes.
   Each mechanism is tested for its ability to explain the key features of
   the observations, particularly with regard to the abruptness, millennial
   recurrence, and geographical extent of the observed changes. It is found
   that each of these mechanisms has explanatory strengths and weaknesses,
   and key areas in which progress could be made in improving the
   understanding of their long-term behavior, both from observational and
   modeling approaches, are suggested. Finally, it is proposed that a
   complete understanding of the mechanisms of abrupt change requires
   inclusion of processes at both low and high latitudes, as well as the
   potential for feedbacks between them. Some suggestions for experimental
   approaches to test for such feedbacks with coupled climate models are
   given.}},
